# Morgan & Morgan Mate: UCF 2023 Morgan & Morgan Hackathon

### "What do you cut?"
This was the question we were tasked to solve for this hackathon, to remove an hour of case management. But in the massive scale of legal suits, we were wondering what takes the most amount of time.

### Translation
The notion of comprehension was the main thing we were tasked on speeding up. Especially in the Oviedo area with a massive Hispanic population, not everyone comprehends cases in English, and the use of a translator would take much more time to explain legal documents to. Thus, our mobile app aids to translate legal documents to the common person, and is able to further translate these questions into Haitan Creole and Spanish.

### Tech Used:
React/Native, Google Vision OCR, OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
